                <p>
                    My name is Torbjørn, but people call me Toronto. 
                    I'm a <span id="yearsold">XX</span> years old ¤student at the ¤Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
                    My major is computer science, and I have taken a special liking to game design and developing ¤algorithms for use in games.
                    On my ¤<a href="index.html">Projects page</a> you can search through various ¤projects I have participated in.
                    If you're not interested in that and rather want to read this wall of text, I won't stop you.

                        I took a bachelor of informatics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology

                        A student organization all about game development.
                        We work on a game called <a href="https://github.com/immerse-ntnu/bfh-client">Battle for Hermannia</a>,
                        and teach game development to aspiring programmers. 
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Casual Gaming</b> (2021): 
                        A casual gaming organization in Trondheim that hosts a big LAN party once every year called "TrøndeLAN".
                        I worked on setup and providing assistance during the event.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Cogito NTNU</b> (2020-2021): 
                        A student organization working on projects related to AI.
                        I was part of the dev team, which develops and maintains their <a href="https://cogito-ntnu.no">website</a>.
                        I also participated in one of their projects about AI agents playing in games, "Spill-AI".
                        In that project I worked on setting up the game enviroment and providing an interface
                        so that other groups could train an agent in our game.
